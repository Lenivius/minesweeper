# minesweeper
Object Oriented Programming project that I did with a friend of mine during my studies.

One of the subjects demanded programming an OOP application and we chose to create a simple game based on Microsoft's Minesweeper game. We added some additional features, to make the program a little bit more complicated.

Graphic interface was created using C++ dedicated library by the name of SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library).
